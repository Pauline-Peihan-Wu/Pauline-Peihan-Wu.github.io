  <p>As this semester goes on, we are starting to learn about new develop environment which I have never heard about before. In addition, we have to follow some standards for how you suppose to write the code.</p>

<p>Everything in our daliy life has standard. Although people don’t always follow it but the standards are there. But I know for sure, under one situation people will and must follow the standard, which is when playing game.</p>

<h2 id="game-vs-coding-standard">Game vs. Coding Standard</h2>

<p>Whenever people playing a game, there would be mission to accomplish. However, in order to get to complete the mission, there would be certain standard the player has to meet in order to pursue the mission. Which is similar to the coding standard. You have to have the correct way of writing code in order to get that green check mark at the top right corner of the window. I think the plugin software(ESLint) is like the helping tool in the game, it tells you where the mistake is and what kind of mistake you have. It is a important tool on your way to that green mark.</p>

<p>It is just the beginning of coding according to the coding standard. There will eventually be more standard to follow. It might be hard, but this will help us in the long run and make it a habit to code according to the standard. I think people will definitely feel accomplished after they get that green check mark and saying out loud, “Yes! It is green!” We will all become the master of coding standard in no time.</p>
